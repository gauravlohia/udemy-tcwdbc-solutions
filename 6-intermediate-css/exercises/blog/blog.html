        <p class="firstPara">Sum expectantes. Ego hodie expectantes. Expectantes, et misit unum de pueris Gus
            interficere. Et suus
            vos. Nescio quis, qui est bonus usus liberi ad Isai? Qui nosti ... Quis dimisit filios ad necem ... hmm?
            Gus! Est, ante me factus singulis decem gradibus. Et nunc ad aliud opus mihi tandem tollendum est puer
            ille consensus et nunc fugit. Ipse suus obtinuit eam. Non solum autem illa, sed te tractantur in se
            trahens felis.</p>

        <p>No! Hoc non credant? Gus habet cameras ubique placet. Audire te! Non, omnia novit, omnia simul. Ubi eras
            hodie? In Lab! Et vos nolite cogitare suus 'possible ut Tyrus de cigarette elevaverunt CAPSA vestris?
            Age! Tu non vides? Pompeius extrema partem es. Tu omne quod ille voluit.</p>

        <p>Tu nunc coci ejus. Tu autem cocus Lab et probavimus liceat mihi sine causa est nunc coci interficere.
            Reputo it! Suus egregie. Ut antecedat. Quod si putas me posse facere, ergo ante. Pone aute in caput, et
            nunc interficere. Faciat! Fac. Fac. Fac.</p>

        <p class="firstPara">I figured I could cut classes for the rest of the semester and he couldn't flunk me as
            long as I, you
            know,
            made the thing. So I finished it in a couple days. And it looked pretty lame, but it worked. You know,
            for
            putting in or whatnot. So when I showed it to Mr. Pike for my grade, he looked at it and said: 'Is that
            the
            best you can do?'</p>

        <p>At first I thought to myself 'Hell yeah, bitch. Now give me a D and shut up so I can go blaze one with my
            boys.' I don't know. Maybe it was the way he said it, but... it was like he wasn't exactly saying it
            sucked.
            He was just asking me honestly, 'Is that all you got?' And for some reason, I thought to myself: 'Yeah,
            man,
            I can do better.'</p>

        <p>So I started from scratch. I made another, then another. And by the end of the semester, by like box
            number
            five, I had built this thing. You should have seen it. It was insane. I mean, I built it out of Peruvian
            walnut with inlaid zebrawood. It was fitted with pegs, no screws, I sanded it for days, until it was
            smooth
            as glass. Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil so it was rich and dark. It even smelled good. You
            know,
            you put nose in it and breathed in, it was... it was perfect.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">This is yet another article</h2>
        <p class="firstPara">A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears!
            It ceases to exist
            without me. No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger,
            Skyler. I AM the danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one
            who
            knocks!</p>

        <p>Did he speak to you? Would you just answer? What things? What people? A month ago, Gus was trying to kill
            both of us. And now, he pulls you out of the lab and employs you as... what... a, an assistant gunman? A
            tough guy? Does that make any sense to you? He says he sees something in you. What kind of game is he
            playing. Does he think you're that na√Øve? He can't truly think that you'd forget... let alone Gale, let
            alone Victor... and all the horror that goes along with all of that.</p>

        <p>It's enough. This is still the best way. You go after him with a gun, you'll never get out of it alive.
            But
            with this... you slip it into his food or drink, there shouldn't be any taste or smell... thirty-six
            hours
            later... poof. A man his age, working as hard as he does... no one will be surprised. Mike can have his
            suspicions, but that's all they'll be. Please, one homicidal maniac at a time.</p>
